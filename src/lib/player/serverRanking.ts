// src/lib/player/serverRanking.ts — how the player decides WHICH server to play.
//
// Client-safe by construction: no `astro:env`, no provider URLs, no secrets, so
// this module is imported by both the React islands and by src/lib/embed.ts on
// the server. It is the single source of truth for
//   • the declared per-server quality registry (SERVER_QUALITY),
//   • the weighted scoring model (SCORE_WEIGHTS / scoreServer) and the ranking
//     built on it (rankServers),
//   • the per-server reliability ledger recorded from real playback outcomes,
//   • the per-title manual override that survives re-renders and remounts.
//
// WHY A WEIGHTED SCORE AND NOT "servers[0]"
// The backend hands back a list sorted by probe result. Taking the head of that
// list is not a decision, it is an accident of registry order: two servers that
// both answered the probe tie, and the tie is broken by whichever was declared
// first in EMBED_SERVER_META. This module makes the choice explicit: every
// signal we actually have is scored 0…1, weighted by product priority (playback
// success first, then quality, response time, buffering speed, reliability) and
// summed, so a strong signal can outweigh a weak one instead of being masked by
// whichever comparison happened to run first. Disqualifications — failed for
// this title, unreachable from this network — stay outside the arithmetic as
// hard gates.
//
// HONESTY ABOUT QUALITY DATA — READ BEFORE POPULATING SERVER_QUALITY
// Resolution and bitrate are NOT introspectable for these providers: each one
// renders its own player in JavaScript inside a cross-origin iframe, so the
// parent page can never read the rendition it selected. There is therefore no
// measurement we can take that would fill these fields in, and inventing values
// would make the ranking lie in a way nobody could debug. Every entry below is
// deliberately null until real, sourced numbers exist (see the comment on
// SERVER_QUALITY for exactly what is needed). Until then `rankServers` falls
// through to the signals that ARE real and measured:
//   evidence (live > title-verified > online) → reliability → probe latency.

//   1. how ad-intrusive each provider's OWN cross-origin player is (pop-ups,
//      redirect tabs, overlay banners), and
//   2. how reliably that provider actually starts a stream in a real browser.

// confirmed play or a recorded failure) exists — which is exactly what lets the
// automatic pick land on a clean, working server in well under a second without
// waiting for the (advisory, often-throttled) probe to answer.
//
// LOWER = preferred. Maintainer-curated and safe to re-tune as providers change:
//   vidlink, vidfast — leanest players, sandbox-friendly, the fewest pop-ups.
//   videasy          — reliable, a little heavier.
